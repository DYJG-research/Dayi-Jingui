# 🧠 Model Capabilities / Building a "Thinking" TCM AI Brain

- **TCM Domain Large Language Model**: Pre-trained on massive classic medical cases and modern clinical data, possessing deep capabilities in Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment. Includes specialized models such as the Expert LLM, Oncology LLM, and Gynecology LLM.

- **TCM Consultation LLM**: Based on TCM theories, it simulates the diagnostic thinking of renowned physicians. It accurately collects multi-diagnostic information through natural interaction and provides recommendations for Chinese Patent Medicines, personalized dietary therapy, and Daoyin health exercises. It covers internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, and spleen-stomach disorders.

- **TCM Constitution Identification LLM**: Relying on the "Dayi-Jingui" foundational model, it integrates data from tongue diagnosis, face diagnosis, and inquiry to achieve rapid and accurate identification of common TCM constitutions, such as Balanced Constitution (Pinghe), Yang-Deficiency Constitution (Yangxu), Yin-Deficiency Constitution (Yinxu), and Phlegm-Dampness Constitution (Tanshi).

- **TCM Feature Detection LLM**: Supports precise extraction of key features from tongue images, including tongue body color, coating color, tooth marks, and coating thickness. It also conducts multi-dimensional compliance detection for the tongue images to be analyzed.
